# nse-vertical_mobility_analysis
## Vertical mobility analysis on NSE Experiment data conducted by Applied Complexity Group
### Objective: To detect vertical movement (elevators, escalators, and stairs) of humans using recordings of sensors used by students from different schools in Singapore  
#### Various steps involved:
1. Data cleaning
2. Preliminary data analysis
3. Analysis using Co-presence Networks
4. Classification of vertical data using Machine Learning algorithms
5. Amplifying existing dataset by methodical experimentation
